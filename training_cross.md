User: Right now, I am trying to have .t7 files to pass through cross-encoder training that I can train it under multiple settings. For each mention, I have top64 retrieved candidates and the candidates representation are ids tokenized from kb.jsonl. But I also want to have the generated (prime) titles that are newly generated titles from each mention object in the .jsonl files. I am wondering if my current setup is correct ?

AI: Looking at your current setup in nn_prediction.py, I can see you're on the right track, but there's a potential issue with how you're handling the "prime" candidates.

Current Setup Analysis:

What you're doing correctly:

You're saving nn_candidates_prime which contains the tokenized representation from candidate_input[i] (the gold entity from the mention's .jsonl file)
You're saving nn_candidates which contains the top-k retrieved candidates from kb.jsonl
You're tracking both nn_labels (position in top-k) and nn_labels_idx (original entity ID)
Potential Issue: The candidate_input[i] represents the gold entity from the .jsonl file (which may have the generated/prime title), but you're only saving one "prime" candidate per mention. However, if you want to train the cross-encoder with all 64 candidates having their prime titles (not just the gold one), you'll need to modify the approach.

Questions to clarify your intent:

Do you want only the gold entity to use the prime title, while the other 63 retrieved candidates use their original kb.jsonl representations?

Or do you want all 64 candidates to be re-tokenized using their prime titles if available?

If it's option 2, you'd need to:

Have a mapping from entity IDs to their prime titles
Re-tokenize all 64 retrieved candidates using their prime titles instead of using the pre-computed candidate_pool
Current setup is correct if: You want the cross-encoder to learn to distinguish between:

Retrieved candidates (using original kb.jsonl text)
Gold entity (using generated prime title)
This would teach the model that prime titles are "better" representations and should be ranked higher.

Could you clarify which scenario matches your training objective?

Answer: 

Do you want only the gold entity to use the prime title, while the other 63 retrieved candidates use their original kb.jsonl representations? Yes, only the gold entity to use the prime title, so we can basically replace the original gold entity row (with original title) in the candidate representation tensor by the new entity representation.

Or do you want all 64 candidates to be re-tokenized using their prime titles if available? No, there is no need. 

The answers are for training only. For valid, test, we always use the original entity titles.
